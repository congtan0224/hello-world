# hello-world
My first repository on Github, just a step of my code journey.
## A little bit of myself:
  </br>I am designer 👓, you could call me [Cong] 🧅, I love techno 🎼, also I am on my way to become a DJ 🎛️, still has a lot to learn 🤣.
  <br/>And a new human-being 😮 in the world of Code. Hopefully, I could learn coding ⌨️ consistently.
  <br/>This is just a starter 🥣, wait until the end of the dessert 🍧. See ya.
